How to use:

1: Put the .jar in the minecraft folder in your mods folder, make sure you use the right version of forge.
2: Upload the .ino file to your board and connect the LCD display how it's recommended on the arduino site, with the only difference being V0 that connects to pin 6
3: Start minecraft and use /SD to connect to the right port (you can find it either in the device manager or in the arduino ide)
